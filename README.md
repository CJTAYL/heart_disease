## Executive Summary 
Four machine learning algorithms were used to predict heart disease in a set of patients. The algorithms used were (a) Logistic regression, (b) Random forest, (d) Support-vector machine, and (e) k-Nearest neighbor. All models were built with Scikit-learn. The models were evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC). The results of the project indicated that logistic regression was the best performing algorithm. 

## Abstract
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart or coronary disease (CD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. However, with early diagnosis, current therapies are capable of significantly improving patient outcomes. One way to facilitate early diagnosis is through increased screenings. By providing medical professionals with easy-to-use tools, targeted screening could be implemented more frequently, which should facilitate the onset of therapy. The purpose of this research project was to demonstrate how a screening tool for CD can be built using basic data mining methods and publicly available datasets.
